## Introduction

In this project, I create a small honeynet in Azure and aggregate log data from various sources into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel uses this data to generate attack maps, trigger alerts, and create incidents. I first measured several security metrics in an unsecured environment for 24 hours, then applied security controls to strengthen the environment and measured the metrics again for another 24 hours. The results, which will be presented below, include:

SecurityEvent: Windows Event Logs
Syslog: Linux Event Logs
SecurityAlert: Alerts Triggered in Log Analytics
SecurityIncident: Incidents Generated by Sentinel
AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL: Malicious Flows Allowed into the Honeynet

## Architecture After Hardening / Security Controls

The architecture of the mini honeynet in Azure consists of the following components:

- Virtual Network (VNet)
- Network Security Group (NSG)
- Virtual Machines (2 windows, 1 linux)
- Log Analytics Workspace
- Azure Key Vault
- Azure Storage Account
- Microsoft Sentinel

For the "BEFORE" metrics, all resources were originally deployed, exposed to the internet. The Virtual Machines had both their Network Security Groups and built-in firewalls wide open, and all other resources are deployed with public endpoints visible to the Internet; aka, no use for Private Endpoints.

For the "AFTER" metrics, Network Security Groups were hardened by blocking ALL traffic with the exception of my admin workstation, and all other resources were protected by their built-in firewalls as well as Private Endpoint

## Metrics Before Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our insecure environment for 24 hours:


| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 23009
| Syslog                   | 2467
| SecurityAlert            | 25
| SecurityIncident         | 230
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 760

## Attack Maps Before Hardening / Security Controls

```All map queries actually returned no results due to no instances of malicious activity for the 24 hour period after hardening.```

## Metrics After Hardening / Security Controls

The following table shows the metrics we measured in our environment for another 24 hours, but after we have applied security controls:


| Metric                   | Count
| ------------------------ | -----
| SecurityEvent            | 5693
| Syslog                   | 12
| SecurityAlert            | 0
| SecurityIncident         | 0
| AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL | 0

## Conclusion

In this project, a small honeynet was set up in Microsoft Azure, and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was used to generate alerts and create incidents based on these logs. Metrics were initially measured in an unsecured environment, and then again after applying security controls. The results show a significant reduction in both security events and incidents after implementing the security measures, highlighting their effectiveness.

Additionally, it is important to consider that if the network resources had been heavily used by regular users, there might have been more security events and alerts in the 24 hours following the application of the security controls.
